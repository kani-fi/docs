## What is KANI ？

Based on YFI, YFII, and Balancer, we creatively proposed the initial pool, AIP Pool, and claim mining methods. The project is completely 0 pre-mined, 0 private placement, and all rules are fair and open.

## Initial Pool 

The proportion of Initial Pool is 5%, the number of KANI is 500,000, and the upper limit of accepted ETH is 1,000;

Users can deposit ETH, and the corresponding KANI will be returned at a ratio of 1:500, of which 10% of KANI will be returned on the spot, and the remaining 90% of KANI will unlock 1% every day for the next 90 days;

All ETH provided by Initial Volunteer will be transferred to the AIP Pool;

## AIP Pool (Automatic Investment Plan )

- AIP Pool will put 50% ETH into the liquidity Pool to provide liquidity. After the liquidity Pool starts, 1% of the ETH will be put into the WETH/KANI currency pair in the liquidity Pool every day for 100 days.
 - In 0-100 days, users of the initial pool can claim kani every day
 - After 20 days, users of the initial pool can claim bpt twice, and bpt can be exchanged for kani+eth.
 - The remaining 50% of ETH will be used for KANI repurchase and to establish Uniswap and Balancer liquidity
## Stable Pool 

KANI supports DAI's stable coin mining. 5% of the total KANI will be injected into the Stable Pool for mining. The mining output rule is 100 days average release

## Liquidity Pool 

80% of the total amount of KANI will be invested in the liquidity Pool. The mining output rules refer to santoshi. The 7-day halving design. The first batch of supported currency pairs "WETH KANI", "USDT KANI", "YFII KANI", "OKB KANI", "HT KANI", 5% KANI is injected into each flow cell.

The remaining 55% of KANI is voted by the governance pool to determine which currency pair to support.

## Governance  Pool 

For all claim operations of Stable Pool and Liquidity Pool, 5% of KANI will be automatically transferred to the Government Pool, which will be shared equally by users in the governance pool.

Governance Pool reserved 5% of kani, released on average 365 days

Which currency pairs are supported by the remaining 55% of KANI in the liquidity Pool, and the use of 55% of KANI is determined by voting by all members of the Government Pool
    
## Dev Team

Dev Team only retains 5% of tokens for development, operation and maintenance costs. The token part of Dev Team is released in 100 antennas from the initial pool, and only 1% is released every day

## Claim is Mining：

For every cliam operation of Stable Pool and Liquidity Pool, 5% of the token will be sent to the Government Pool for participation in governance. That is, Claim is mining!


# How to get KANI and when will it start?
